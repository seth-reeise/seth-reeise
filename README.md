### Welcome to my profile 🔋

My name is Seth Reeise and I am a software engineer with a bachelors in Computer Science. I enjoy both front end and backend but tend to perfer backend more. 

At present, I am dedicated to expanding my proficiency in AWS. As part of this pursuit, I am actively engaged in deploying the Divine Canine administrative website/API projects to AWS.
